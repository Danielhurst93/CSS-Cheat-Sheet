CSS cheat sheet

What's up guys, so here is the CSS cheat sheet I've created with the help of YouTube, Goolge and https://www.w3schools.com/. 

I've tried to explain the most difficult concepts as much as I could.

If you take a look at the file, you will see that every section is marked. 

For example:

/*----------------
    CSS COLORS 
-----------------*/

This means that anything below this, is related to CSS Colors. 

Also, a lot of the declaration blocks contain random selectors like h1, p, span, div's, etc. 

If you want to take a look at what the declaration block does, I STRONGLY SUGGEST you try it out on codepen.io or on an
empty index.html file with a linked CSS file in order to visualise whats going on. 

I am 100% sure I've made some spelling mistakes, I dont feel like reading EVERYTHING and correcting them. This is why
YOU guys will be allowed to modify the file "as you wish" and push the commits. 

When can you modify the file?

  - If you can find a better way to explain what I've said, PLEASE do so. 
  - If you found something false, please correct it.
  - If you find spelling mistakes, PLEASE correct those. 
  - If you think I missed anything usefull, please add those things.
  
I want to be able to create a BETTER cheat sheet with your help guys! I think it would be amazing if anyone can take it
and learn from it! 

Anyways this cheat sheet is pretty much all yours guys, I'm just trying to establish some rules so it doesnt get messy!

Thanks boyzz and gurlzz!
